# Steps:

Determine needs
- I want to develop a basic static website
- I want to be able to develop it on github codespaces

In order to see live changes to the code while I work on the HTML/CSS, 
I look for a package that lets me view live changes.

I install Browser-sync. An added benefit is being able to simultaneously
view it on my phone and desktop screen while developing.
