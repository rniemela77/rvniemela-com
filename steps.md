# Steps:

Determine needs
- I want to develop a basic static website
- I want to be able to develop it on github codespaces

In order to see live changes to the code while I work on the HTML/CSS, 
I look for a package that lets me view live changes.

I discover Hugo handles this and makes content changes in the future easier.

I `npm install hugo`
